Instructions for sampling the application.

1. Download & Install Android Studio... http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

2. Clone the repository and open in android studio (Open an existing android studio project, and navigate to the folder).

3. Create an emulator in android studio, version 14 - 23 (Android Kitkat to Marshmallow)

4. Once android studio has finished indexing and the gradle has finished. Run the app... with the emulator already open. Android studio will ask which device, select the emulator and the app should boot automatically.

Any problems please contact me.
